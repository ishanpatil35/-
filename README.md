# Tetris-on-Kubernetes

## Overview
This project is an exciting exploration of GitOps within an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster. We've combined the power of Kubernetes with the classic game Tetris to showcase the efficiency and reliability of GitOps in managing deployments.

## Project Steps

### Step 1: IAM Roles
- Created IAM roles for both the EKS cluster and node groups to ensure secure access and management.

### Step 2: EKS Cluster
- Established a robust EKS cluster as the foundation for our Kubernetes operations.

### Step 3: ArgoCD Setup
- Implemented ArgoCD, a GitOps tool, for automated deployments and integration with our EKS cluster.

### Step 4: Game Update
- Seamlessly updated Tetris with ArgoCD, demonstrating the power of automation.

### Step 5: Cleanup
- Efficiently managed resources and maintained a clean environment to wrap up the project.

## Project Outcome
The combination of GitOps and Kubernetes has streamlined our deployments, making them more reliable and efficient. Not only have we delved into the world of GitOps, but we've also set new high scores in Tetris! üèÜ
